    Send a generic email to any number of recipients. This allows a scheduled

    This is 'generic' because it must follow these rules:
    - The email template cannot be passed any parameters
    - There are no CC addresses; all users (in the *args parameter) are sent
    the same email, each with their own version.

    Parameters
    ----------
    template_str : str
        Either the name of the email template to use (specified in the .env file
        with a corresponding template ID) or the template ID itself. The name
        will be checked first.
    *args : str
        Each arg is the email address of a recipient. Each recipient will be
        sent the email specified by ``template_str`` (these will not be sent
