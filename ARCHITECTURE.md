Get-Your is an online application for income-qualified programs supported by any organization.

This was created for the City of Fort Collins, so references will be to their version of the app, 'Get FoCo'.

# Background

The City of Fort Collins provides many income-qualified programs to residents. Prior to Get-Your (and Get FoCo), however, these programs would typically require applicants to

1. Travel in-person to the department that runs a program
1. Fill out a physical form and provide income-verification documentation (usually tax forms)
1. Wait to hear if they've been enrolled (and each program had different methods of response)
    1. This could take quite a while due to the overextended staff at each department

Furthermore, almost every program is run from a different department! These steps posed a large barrier for members of the low-income community, especially because of the amount of time it takes to travel to an office. There was also the problem that Fort Collins didn't have many applicants with overlapping programs, even though most programs have the same level of qualification requirements. This was attributed to the difficulty in learning about the available programs.

Get-Your was designed to solve these problems.

- The first key feature is that users fill out a *single* application which is applicable to all income-qualified programs on the platform. Filling out information only once is a huge reduction in effort for potential applicants
- With it being online-only, there is no travel time. Studies have shown that smartphone usage as a sole Internet-enabled device is high among the intended audience of Get-Your, so it has a mobile-first design
    - For those without Internet access, the application can be filled out at public libraries
    - Critically, for those uncomfortable with web interfaces, the City of Fort Collins has set up in-person help at popular community locations (e.g. the Fort Collins Senior Center)
- Applicants will need to upload ID and paperwork, which can be done with a smartphone camera
    - Additionally, these documents are now stored securely (and soon to be governed by a data retention policy). Since tax forms are no longer allowed, critical PII is not stored at all
- Because there is a single application per user, dedicated staff can be tasked with verifying documents. Once a user has been verified, each program's department only needs to perform their process of enrolling users (no longer verifying themselves)
    - Wait times are lower, and the online nature of the platform can give feedback to the user
